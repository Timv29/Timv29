Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Tim van Vugt, I am 24 years old and I live in the Netherlands.
I am currently learning webdevelopment at REA College Eindhoven, but my interests are also in game development and software engineering and I plan to learn more about that in the near future.

I love music and although I don't pick up my bass as much as I would like to these days, I still enjoy listening to just about anything.
